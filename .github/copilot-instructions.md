This solution contains a Blazor WebAssembly frontend, an ASP.NET Core backend, and xUnit test projects for both. Use .NET 9 SDK for all development and testing.
Always check online documentation for the latest features and best practices.
Write and check unit tests for both frontend and backend to ensure code quality.
Use the az and gh CLI tools for Azure and GitHub operations, respectively.
Do not teach me but do the work yourself.
**ALWAYS deploy infrastructure and application using the GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows`. NEVER use direct az CLI or local/agent-side deployment for infrastructure.**
Use the provided GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD and all Azure deployments.
Use the `dotnet` CLI for building, testing, and running the projects.
Use the `dotnet watch` command for live reloading during development.
Use the `dotnet ef` CLI for database migrations and updates.
The commit messages should be clear and descriptive, following the conventional commits style.
after pushing changes to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflows will automatically trigger deployments to Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions. 
Check for successful runs and also check the used resources in azure for correct configuration.
Lint all infrastructure code and use only bicep for infrastructure as code.
Lint and test the infrastructure before deploying.
When searching the web for solutions, prefer official documentation and trusted sources. The current year is 2025 if you need to know it.

## GitHub Actions Workflow Guidelines
**NEVER create centralized orchestrator workflows** like `main-ci-cd.yml` that try to coordinate multiple deployments or detect changes across components. Instead:
- Use focused, single-responsibility workflows for each component (infrastructure, client, server)
- Use path-based triggers directly in individual workflows (`paths:` in `on.push` or `on.pull_request`)
- Each workflow should be autonomous and handle its own triggering conditions
- Avoid complex dependency chains between workflows
- Keep workflows simple, maintainable, and debuggable

This prevents unnecessary complexity, reduces failure points, and follows modern CI/CD best practices.

When writing yaml or yml files , always use the correct syntax and indentation. Always validate your YAML files using a linter or validator before committing them to the repository

**CRITICAL: Always use a YAML linter (like `npx yaml-lint <file>`) when editing workflow files to prevent formatting loops and syntax errors. This prevents deployment failures caused by invalid YAML.**

Always update the readme file. Mention that this is a vibe coding test and no line of code was written by a human. The code is generated by AI and the readme is written by AI. The code is not tested and may not work as expected. The code is not optimized for performance or security. The code is not production ready and should not be used in production environments.
