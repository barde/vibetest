# 🤖 CopilotBlazor - AI Generated Vibe Test 🧠✨

> ⚠️ **AI Generated Code Notice** ⚠️  
> This is a **vibe coding test** where **no line of code was written by a human**. Every single piece of code, infrastructure, and this README was generated by AI. The code is not tested, may not work as expected, is not optimized for performance or security, and is **NOT production ready**. This project is for **educational purposes only**.

🌟 A modern web application built with Blazor WebAssembly and Azure Functions, featuring automatic deployment to Azure Static Web Apps.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This AI-generated solution contains:
- 🌐 `Client`: Blazor WebAssembly frontend (deployed to Azure Static Web Apps)
- ⚡ `Server`: Azure Functions v4 backend (.NET 9) 
- 🧪 `Client.Tests`: xUnit tests for the frontend
- 🔬 `Server.Tests`: xUnit tests for the backend
- 🏛️ `Infra`: Bicep infrastructure as code for Azure deployment

## 🚀 Features

- 🆕 **Modern Stack**: .NET 9, Blazor WebAssembly, Azure Functions v4
- 🌍 **Global CDN**: Azure Static Web Apps with worldwide edge distribution
- 🔋 **Serverless Backend**: Azure Functions with HTTP triggers (linked to Static Web Apps)
- 💓 **Keep-Alive Mechanism**: Timer-based availability tests to prevent cold starts
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Application Insights with availability testing and alerts
- 🔄 **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code**: Bicep templates for consistent deployments
- 🔒 **Security**: Custom headers, CORS configuration, and built-in authentication support

## 🆚 Hosting Comparison

| Feature | Azure Static Web Apps | Storage Account Static Hosting |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Custom Headers | ✅ Full support | ❌ Requires Azure CDN |
| Authentication | ✅ Built-in providers | ❌ Not supported |
| CI/CD Integration | ✅ Native GitHub/Azure DevOps | ❌ Manual setup required |
| API Integration | ✅ Seamless proxy to Functions | ❌ CORS complexity |
| Staging Environments | ✅ Automatic PR previews | ❌ Not available |
| Custom Domains | ✅ Free SSL included | ✅ Manual SSL setup |
| Global CDN | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Requires separate CDN |

**🎯 Recommendation**: Azure Static Web Apps provides superior developer experience and features for modern web applications.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- 🔧 .NET 9 SDK
- ☁️ Azure CLI (for deployment)
- 💳 Azure subscription (for cloud deployment)

## 💻 Local Development

### 🔨 Build
```bash
dotnet build CopilotBlazor.sln
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Run Backend (Azure Functions)
```bash
cd Server
func start
# or
dotnet run
```

### 🌐 Run Frontend
```bash
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```

### 🧪 Run All Tests
```bash
dotnet test CopilotBlazor.sln
```

## ☁️ Azure Deployment

🤖 The AI-generated application deploys to Azure Static Web Apps for the frontend and Azure Functions for the backend. All deployment happens through GitHub Actions workflows.

### 🚀 Quick Setup

1. **🔐 Configure GitHub Secrets** (required):
   ```
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID          # Azure service principal client ID
   AZURE_TENANT_ID          # Azure tenant ID  
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID    # Azure subscription ID
   ```

2. **🏗️ Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Go to Actions → "Deploy Azure Infrastructure" → Run workflow
   - Copy the deployment outputs to configure additional secrets

3. **🔑 Add Required Secret**:
   ```
   AZURE_BASE_NAME                    # From infrastructure deployment output
   ```

   💡 The Static Web Apps deployment token is automatically retrieved from Azure - no manual configuration needed!

4. **🚢 Deploy Application**:
   - Push to main/master branch to trigger automatic deployment
   - Both frontend and backend will deploy automatically

### 🔄 Deployment Workflows

- �️ **Infrastructure**: `deploy-infra.yml` - Deploys when `Infra/` changes
- 🌐 **Frontend**: `deploy-client.yml` - Deploys when `Client/` changes  
- ⚡ **Backend**: `deploy-server.yml` - Deploys when `Server/` changes

### 🎯 Monorepo Efficiency

The AI-optimized workflows feature:
- 🎯 **Path-based triggers** - Only run when relevant files change
- ⚡ **Separate test jobs** - Fast feedback for pull requests  
- 🔄 **Component isolation** - Independent deployments for each service
- 🤝 **Automatic coordination** - GitHub Actions handles scheduling and dependencies

### 🌐 Live URLs

After AI deployment, your application will be available at:
- 🏠 **Frontend**: `https://<static-web-app-name>.azurestaticapps.net`
- 🔌 **API**: Integrated through Static Web Apps proxy (no CORS issues)
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Azure Portal → Application Insights

### 🛠️ API Endpoints

- `GET /api/weatherforecast` - 🌤️ Returns weather forecast data
- `GET /api/keepalive` - 💓 Keep-alive endpoint for monitoring
