# 🤖 CopilotBlazor - AI Generated Vibe Test

> ⚠️ **AI Generated Code Notice**: This is a vibe coding test where **no line of code was written by a human**. The code is generated by AI, not tested, may not work as expected, and is **NOT production ready**. For educational purposes only.

Modern Blazor WebAssembly + Azure Functions application with automated deployment using GitHub Actions OIDC authentication.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- 🌐 **Client**: Blazor WebAssembly frontend (Azure Static Web Apps)
- ⚡ **Server**: Azure Functions v4 backend (.NET 9) 
- 📦 **Shared**: Common models library (Azure API Guidelines compliant)
- 🏛️ **Infra**: Bicep infrastructure as code
- 📚 **Docs**: OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification

## 🚀 Features

- .NET 9, Blazor WebAssembly, Azure Functions v4
- GitHub Actions with OIDC authentication (keyless deployment)
- Azure Static Web Apps with global CDN
- OpenAPI specification following Azure API Guidelines
- Type-safe shared models between client and server

## 💻 Local Development

```bash
# Build and test
dotnet build CopilotBlazor.sln
dotnet test CopilotBlazor.sln

# Run backend
cd Server && dotnet run

# Run frontend (separate terminal)
cd Client && dotnet run
```

## ☁️ Azure Deployment

Uses **GitHub Actions with OIDC** for secure, keyless deployment.

### Setup (One-time)

1. **Azure Setup**: Create service principal with federated identity credentials for GitHub
   - 📚 **Guide**: [Configuring OpenID Connect in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure)

2. **GitHub Secrets**:
   ```
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID        # Service principal client ID
   AZURE_TENANT_ID        # Azure tenant ID  
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID  # Azure subscription ID
   ```

### Deploy

1. **Infrastructure**: Actions → "Deploy Azure Infrastructure" → Run workflow
2. **Application**: Push code changes (auto-deploys on path changes)

### Workflows

- 🏗️ `deploy-infra.yml` - Infrastructure (when `Infra/` changes)
- 🌐 `deploy-client.yml` - Frontend (when `Client/` changes)  
- ⚡ `deploy-server.yml` - Backend (when `Server/` changes)

## 📖 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/weatherforecast` | 5-day weather forecast |
| `GET /api/health` | Application health status |
| `GET /api/keepalive` | Service availability check |
