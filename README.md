## 📋 Prerequisites

- 🔧 .NET 9 SDK
- ☁️ Azure CLI (for deployment)
- 💳 Azure subscription (for cloud deployment)

## 💻 Local Development

### 🔨 Build
```bash
dotnet build CopilotBlazor.sln
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Run Backend (Azure Functions)
```bash
cd Server
func start
# or
dotnet run
```

### 🌐 Run Frontend
```bash
dotnet run --project Client/Client.csproj
```

### 🧪 Run All Tests
```bash
dotnet test CopilotBlazor.sln
```

## ☁️ Azure Deployment

🤖 The AI-generated application deploys to Azure Static Web Apps for the frontend and Azure Functions for the backend. All deployment happens through GitHub Actions workflows.

### 🚀 Quick Setup

1. **🔐 Configure GitHub Secrets** (required):
   ```
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID          # Azure service principal client ID
   AZURE_TENANT_ID          # Azure tenant ID  
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID    # Azure subscription ID
   ```

2. **🏗️ Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Go to Actions → "Deploy Azure Infrastructure" → Run workflow
   - Copy the deployment outputs to configure additional secrets

3. **🔑 Add Required Secret**:
   ```
   AZURE_BASE_NAME                    # From infrastructure deployment output
   ```

   💡 The Static Web Apps deployment token is automatically retrieved from Azure - no manual configuration needed!

4. **🚢 Deploy Application**:
   - Push to main/master branch to trigger automatic deployment
   - Both frontend and backend will deploy automatically

### 🔄 Deployment Workflows

- �️ **Infrastructure**: `deploy-infra.yml` - Deploys when `Infra/` changes
- 🌐 **Frontend**: `deploy-client.yml` - Deploys when `Client/` changes  
- ⚡ **Backend**: `deploy-server.yml` - Deploys when `Server/` changes

### 🎯 Monorepo Efficiency

The AI-optimized workflows feature:
- 🎯 **Path-based triggers** - Only run when relevant files change
- ⚡ **Separate test jobs** - Fast feedback for pull requests  
- 🔄 **Component isolation** - Independent deployments for each service
- 🤝 **Automatic coordination** - GitHub Actions handles scheduling and dependencies

### 🌐 Live URLs

After AI deployment, your application will be available at:
- 🏠 **Frontend**: `https://<static-web-app-name>.azurestaticapps.net`
- 🔌 **API**: Integrated through Static Web Apps proxy (no CORS issues)
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Azure Portal → Application Insights

### 🛠️ API Endpoints

- `GET /api/weatherforecast` - 🌤️ Returns weather forecast data
- `GET /api/keepalive` - 💓 Keep-alive endpoint for monitoring
